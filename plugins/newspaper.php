                                                            Just one week after buying all the land in Generica, the most hated yet respected man in Generica has been busted for selling drugs. After turning his newly acquired land into the basis of his new large-scale
                                                            drug manufactoring operation, he planted acres upon acres of marijuana and harvested it a week later. He then proceeded to go in person to sell his green sticky gold downtown. Luckily for the youth
                                                            of Generica, the local police force had already learned of this (how do you hide that many acres of pot?), and set up a sting operation to catch him in the act. When senatorhades attempted to sell
                                                            the marijuana to the undercover police officer, he lost his weed, and gained a pair of handcuffs. He was hauled off to the local jail and was being held until trial, however he has recently dissapeared
                                                            from the prison. It is unknown whether someone busted him out, or if he escaped on his own.

                                                                After the chemical bombs dropped on New York and Seattle just over a<br /> year ago by terrorists the two cities were finally deemed safe enough for<br /> the public to move back into there homes.
